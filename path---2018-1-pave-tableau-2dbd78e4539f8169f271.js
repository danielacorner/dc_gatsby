Using Tableau, this prototype is the third-place winner of the <a href='https://studentpathwayschallenge.ca/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Student Pathways Challenge</a>, a design competition to help high school students make an informed decision about their professional pursuits. <br/> My team performed user research, competitive analysis of existing solutions, and two rounds of user testing. Our research revealed that in contrast to the prescriptive '20-minute career quiz' approach, students would benefit from a low-commitment, user-first, and engaging exploration of the available career landscape. Using parameters such as income, duration of study, job security, and skills used on the job, Pave takes overwhelming data and allows users to quickly drill down into the areas that interest them.",caption:"Pave is an interactive exploration of Canada's jobs.
