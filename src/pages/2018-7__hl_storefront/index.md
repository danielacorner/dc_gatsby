I was privileged to be able to create a display case and storefront for the beautiful works of Hyeran Lee.

Made with React and Material-UI, and peppered with styled-components and Materialize CSS. It also uses React's Context API to flexibly share data between components without installing Redux.

Now that I'm familiar with React I'm really enjoying its low overhead, lush ecosystem, and enthusiastic community. It's my current go-to framework.

This work is currently in progress; I'm waiting for design feedback before the next iteration.
