An interactive data visualization of Canada's jobs, Pave takes overwhelming data and allows users to quickly drill down into the areas that interest them.

This design is for high school students, and it intends to remain fun and engaging while helping students make the 'decision of their life'.

This is the second-iteration prototype, and it served as my introduction to web development.
