An interactive data visualization of Canada's jobs, Pave takes overwhelming data and allows users to quickly drill down into the areas that interest them.

Now targeting users of all ages and backgrounds, this design is more mature and compact. My team is also beginning to focus on accessibility -- you'll notice a toggle switch at the bottom for a mobile-friendly static viz.

Using the Angular front-end framework, this iteration incorporates the paradigms of functional programming by remaining abstract and composable, and of object-oriented programming by encapsulating components into independent modules.
