At [Random Hack of Kindness #9](https://rhok.ca/), the Ottawa-Carleton Assembly of School Councils team put together a working knowledge library application using Angular and AWS. The app intends to centralize essential knowledge for parents while bringing the Assembly out of the paper age.

Following the hackathon, I volunteered to help out with design and Angular development. This is an ongoing collaboration, so check back later for updates!
