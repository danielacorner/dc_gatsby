caption: "A basic, fully-responsive portfolio site using React."
desc: "This basic portfolio site uses React components and a handful of styling libraries for a fully responsive layout. This was my first project using React. Coming from Angular, my first impression was a good one -- React is a much faster way to develop small projects by scaffolding out your requirements as you go."
