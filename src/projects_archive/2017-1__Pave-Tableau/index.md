An interactive data visualization of Canada's jobs.

Using Tableau, this prototype is the third-place winner of the [Student Pathways Challenge](https://studentpathwayschallenge.ca/), a design competition to help high school students make an informed decision about their future.

My team performed user research, competitive analysis of existing solutions, and two rounds of user testing.

Our research revealed that in contrast to the traditional 20-minute prescriptive career-quiz approach, students would benefit from a low-commitment, user-first, and engaging exploration of the available career landscape.

Pave is a way to invert the control and let users see at each step how their decisions today could affect their futures. It takes overwhelming data and allows users to quickly drill down into the areas that interest them, using parameters such as income, duration of study, risk of tasks being machine-automated, and skills used on the job.
